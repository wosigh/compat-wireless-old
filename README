Linux Wireless compatibility package
=====================================

This is a Linux wireless compatibility package which provides the latest
Linux wireless subsystem enhancements for kernels 2.6.22 and above. We provide
compatibility support since 2.6.22 as that is when mac80211 was introduced
onto the stock kernel. This adds mac80211 and mac80211 drivers as we go on testing
them.

If you'd like to keep the wireless-2.6 git repository local as well, please read
out git-guide which explains how to achieve this:

http://linuxwireless.org/en/developers/git-guide

With a local git repository you can update the compatibility package yourself. 
For more information on how to do this please refer the Developers section below.

Documenation
------------

This package is also documented online.

Where to get the latest
-----------------------

This package lets you build your own 'latest', all you need is a local git repository
checkout of wireless-2.6.git. However since not many users are expected to keep
the git repository updated we provide hourly snapshots against the latest at:

http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2

Building, and installing
------------------------

Build: build the latest linux wireless subsystem

	make

Install:

We use the updates/ directory so your distribution's drivers are left intact.

	sudo make install

Uninstall:

This nukes our changes to updates/ so you can go back to using your
distribution's supported drivers.

	sudo make uninstall

Load:

This unloads your old mac80211 and wireless drivers and loads the new
shiny ones. For example if ipw3945 and its proprietary daemon are found
it'll be stopped and the module unloaded and then iwl3945 will be loaded.

	sudo make load

Known issues
------------

* Strange wireless device names:

On Ubuntu and Fedora you may end up with strange network device names,
for example, wlan0_rename. This is a known issue and will be worked on.

* nl80211:

More compatibility work is needed to add nl80211

* b43:

b43 and b43legacy now loads. Since there was an old softmac broadcom driver 
we provide a load script for this driver. To load the new generation 
drivers (b43 and b43legacy) you can run:

	sudo b43load b43

To revert back to ath5k you can run:

	sudo b43load bcm43xx

* MadWifi:

If MadWifi is present the build system will detect this and disable it. It 
does this by simply renaming ath_pci.ko to ath_pci.ko.ignore. This lets us
disable the MadWifi driver without blacklisting it which could cause issues
with users later. If you would like to enable MadWifi at a later time and
disable ath5k you can run:

	sudo athload madwifi

To revert back to ath5k you can run:

	sudo athload ath5k

* Firmare:

If your driver needs firmware please be sure to check the driver page
for that driver here:

http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers

Why?
----

For users or developers stuck on older kernels that want to help test or 
patch wireless work. Additionally if you're on a recent kernel this lets
you get the latest and greatest wireless-2.6 git work without much effort.
This may mean new drivers for some users. Last but not least we hope this
will encourage vendors and developers to post patches upstream first
rather than forking or maintaining their own mac80211 releases with
their own patches for their own drivers.

How about compatibility work for kernels < 2.6.22 ?
---------------------------------------------------

Sure, feel free to send patches. The main work was designed to support 
kernels >= 2.6.22 as that was when mac80211 was introduced.

Bugs
-----

If you've found a bug please report it to our linux-wireless mailing list:

linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org

Report the bug because you are working with the latest and greatest.
If your bug is compatibility-related then we should still try to fix
it within the compat.[ch] work.

License
-------

This work is a subset of the Linux kernel as such we keep the kernel's
Copyright practice. Some files have their own copyright and in those
cases the license is mentioned in the file. All additional work made
to building this package is licensed under the GPLv2.

Developers
----------

Please try adding new drivers, test them and if they work enable them. You
can then send patches. Compatibility work goes into compat/compat.[ch]. If
using those files do not suffice additional actual code changes can go into
compat/compat.diff.

scripts/admin-clean.sh		- Cleans the compat-wireless-2.6 tree
scripts/admin-update.sh		- Updates compat-wireless-2.6 with your git tree
scripts/admin-refresh.sh	- Does the above two

To add new drivers:

1. Add directory to scripts/admin-update.sh $DRIVERS variable
2. Add new compat-wireless-2.6/ dir to obj-y on the local Makefile
3. Update compat patch:

	cd ..
	cp -a compat-wireless-2.6/ compat-wireless-2.6.old
	cp compat-wireless-2.6/drivers/foo/Makefile compat-wireless-2.6/.old/drivers/Makefile.old
	# edit drivers/foo/Makefile and make necessary changes to enable module
	diff -u compat-wireless-2.6.old/drivers/foo/Makefile.old \
		compat-wireless-2.6/drivers/foo/Makefile >> \
		compat/compat.diff
	# Append to compat/compat.[ch] any new changes needed 
	# to support the driver, please be specific about the reasons 
	# for your additions

4. Refresh and test:
	cd compat-wireless-2.6/
	./scripts/admin-refresh.sh
5. Send patches of the work

Patches for compatibility work
------------------------------

Please send patches against:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/compat-wireless-2.6.git

To: Luis R. Rodriguez <mcgrof@winlab.rutgers.edu>
CC: linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org
Subject: [PATCH] compat-2.6: add driver foo

Patches for drivers
